## An overengineered MadLib

The main attraction of this repo is the homebrewed FuzzyMatcher. I really wanted the user to be able to enter a country incorrectly and have the program still recognize it.

What I came up with so far can be found in **FuzzyMatcher.java**

I wanted to challenge myself to solve this problem without any third party resources or input, although the solution here is inefficient and ugly, I'm proud of coming up with something that works well enough for my use case.
